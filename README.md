🪙 Mintiq - Decentralized Token Launch Factory

Create and manage ERC-20 token sales with dynamic pricing, automatic sale targets, and seamless Web3 integration. Built with Solidity, Next.js, and Ethers.js, this DApp empowers creators to deploy, list, and trade their own tokens effortlessly.

🚀 Overview

Mintiq is a decentralized token launchpad where anyone can:

Deploy new ERC-20 tokens instantly

Manage public token sales with automated price scaling

Allow buyers to purchase tokens directly with ETH

Withdraw raised ETH and remaining tokens after the sale

It also supports:

Developer fee collection

Dynamic pricing logic

Real-time token listing updates

IPFS image uploads for token metadata

🧠 Core Features 🔹 Smart Contracts (Solidity)

Factory Contract

Deploys new ERC-20 tokens.

Manages token sales with auto-targeted fundraising (default: 4 ETH).

Enforces limits (500,000 tokens per sale).

Calculates token cost dynamically using the bonding-curve logic.

Handles sale closing and post-sale deposits.

Token Contract

Standard ERC-20 token built using OpenZeppelin.

Auto-mints total supply to the factory on creation.

Tracks the creator and owner of the token.

🔹 Frontend (Next.js + React)

MetaMask Integration

Connect, disconnect, and manage wallets securely.

Token Listing Dashboard

View active token sales with progress bars for Raised ETH and Tokens Sold.

Create Token Form

Deploy new tokens directly from the browser.

Upload images to IPFS using Pinata.

Dynamic UI Updates

Automatically refreshes token listings after creation.

Displays success states like “🎉 Goal Reached!” when targets are met.

Users connect via MetaMask; contract & network are auto-verified.

2️⃣ Create Token

Fill in:

Token Name

Symbol

Total Supply

Upload Token Image (IPFS via Pinata)

Then click List Token to deploy.

3️⃣ Buy Tokens

Users can view all open listings and buy tokens directly with ETH.

4️⃣ Deposit & Withdraw

After goal achievement:

Creators can withdraw raised funds + unsold tokens.

Developer can withdraw platform fee.

📸 UI Preview Feature Description 🧱 Dashboard Displays all active token sales with dynamic progress bars 🪄 Create Page Form to deploy new tokens 🔁 Trade Modal Buy tokens directly 🌐 IPFS Upload Upload token image securely using Pinata 🔐 Security Checks

✅ Contract reverts on insufficient ETH or invalid input

✅ Tokens auto-locked to prevent overselling

✅ Only owner/creator can perform privileged actions

✅ Uses OpenZeppelin ERC-20 for secure token logic

🧰 Local Setup 📦 Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+)

MetaMask Wallet

Foundry / Hardhat (for local testing)

Pinata API keys (for IPFS upload)

🪜 Steps

1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Atharva-Joshi8999/Mintiq.git

2. Install dependencies
cd MintiqFrontend npm install

3. Add environment variables
Create .env.local file
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_api_key NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

4. Run the app
npm run dev

Then open: 👉 http://localhost:3000

🧪 Smart Contract Deployment

Using Foundry deploy the Factory.sol contract:

forge create src/Factory.sol:Factory --constructor-args 0.01ether --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>

Copy the deployed contract address and update it in:

/src/contract.js → export const contractAddress = "<YOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>";
